# Grocery Store Chain Database readme

This is database for a small but growing grocery store chain, in order to organize their expanding data. 

It contains three tables: product_price, location_info, and product_info, as well as code to insert some fabricated placeholder data for each (fill_products.sql, fill_locations.sql and fill_products_locations.sql).

You can also find SQL queries that can be used to obtain useful info and for functional analysis to promote growth of the small business.
